TASK-1 Converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales

# Temperature Converter

## Project Overview

The TemperatureConverter project is a Java-based command-line application designed to convert temperatures between three commonly used scales: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The application prompts the user to input a temperature value and specify the unit of measurement. It then performs the necessary conversions and displays the results.

## Features

Converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin.
Converts temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin.
Converts temperatures from Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit.
Handles user input for temperature values and units of measurement.
Provides error messages for invalid inputs.

## Results
The program reads the temperature value and the unit of measurement from the user, performs the appropriate conversions, and prints the results in a formatted output. Below are some examples of how the program works:

### Example 1

Enter the temperature value: 25
Enter the unit of measurement (C for Celsius, F for Fahrenheit, K for Kelvin): C
#### Output:
25.00°C is equal to 77.00°F and 298.15K

## Conclusion

The TemperatureConverter program effectively demonstrates basic temperature conversion between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface for temperature conversions and handles invalid inputs gracefully by informing the user of incorrect units.
